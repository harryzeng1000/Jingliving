      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
      The inception of JingLiving Saunas traces back to 2019, born out of a passion to bring rejuvenation and relaxation into people's homes. When the world was rapidly urbanizing, the founders of JingLiving recognized the need for a sanctuary within homes - a place where one could retreat, relax, and renew. Thus, the idea of JingLiving Sauna Rooms was conceived.

      In the initial stages, the focus was clear: to produce sauna rooms that encapsulated both luxury and functionality. The meticulous choice of wood was pivotal in this venture, leading to the use of African Okoume and Canadian hemlock. Both these woods are renowned for their durability and elegance, ensuring the saunas not only looked exquisite but also lasted a lifetime.
      </p>

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>

By hand-selecting the finest materials like African Okoume and Canadian hemlock wood, we ensure that every JingLiving sauna is not only luxurious but also built to last, offering our customers an oasis of serenity for years to come.
